  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>When you click start, the computer will flash a pattern</p>
  <p>The player must then click on the lights in the same pattern as the computer</p>
  <p>The pattern will increase by one more light for each level</p>
  <p>If the timer is on, player must start entering the pattern before the timer expires</p>
  <p>If the toggle is set to 'Answer in reverse order', player must enter the pattern backwards</p>
  <p>The speed automatically increases by 1 at level 6, 10, and 14</p>
  <p>Failure to enter the correct pattern (or begin entering before timer expires) will result in a loss</p>
  <h3>Scoring</h3>
  <p>Each level of speed is worth one point per level</p>
  <p>(e.g. if you beat a level on speed 5, you get 5 points)</p>
  <p>If you use the timer, your points are multiplied by 1.5X</p>
  <p>If you answer the pattern in reverse, your points are multiplied by 1.5X again</p>
