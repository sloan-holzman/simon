SIMON

A game for generating patterns which are expressed through lights flashing, and then allowing the user to replicate the pattern by clicking on the same lights in the same order.

Current Features

Users can click start to have the application generate a pattern, which gets flashed on the screen
Users can match the pattern by clicking on the same lights
Users can decide to turn on a timer (which decides how quickly the lights are flashed)
Users can decide to turn on 'reverse' (which requires the user to enter the pattern backwards)
User can change the speed for how quickly the lights flash
The application checks if the pattern is correct and/or if the user has started entering the pattern within the alloted time (if the timer is on)
If the pattern is correct, the level increases, the level points are calculated, and their overall score is increased
If the pattern is incorrect (or they do not start answering in time), the application checks if the user's score is within the top ten all time and then displays the top ten scores (including the user's if appropriate)
